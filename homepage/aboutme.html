            <h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
            <h4>6 Seasons, 148 Episodes<h4><br>
            <h5>The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes 
            in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to
            become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.
            </h5>
            <h4>One of my very first animes, HunterxHunter is one of my favorite to this day and the only anime ive ever cried to. I
            loved every season (except Chimera Arc) and its the perfect balance between funny and sweet.
            </h4>
            <h2>9/10</h2><br>

            <h3>Btoom!<br></h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 12 Episodes<br><br></h4>
            <h5>Ryouta Sakamoto is unemployed and lives with his mother, his only real achievement being that he is Japan's top player of the popular online video game Btooom! However,
            his peaceful life is about to change when he finds himself stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere, with a small green crystal embedded
            in his left hand and no memory of how he got there. To his shock, someone has decided to recreate the game he is so fond of in real life, with the stakes being life or death.
            Armed with a bag full of unique bombs known as "BIM," the players are tasked with killing seven of their fellow participants and taking their green crystals in order to
            return home. Initially condemning any form of violence, Ryouta is forced to fight when he realizes that many of the other players are not as welcoming as they may seem. Teaming
            up with Himiko, a fellow Btooom! player, they attempt to get off of the island together, coming closer and closer to the truth behind this contest of death.
            </h5>
            <h4>Btoom is your run of the mill action anime, with the protagonist outsmarting opponents he really shouldn't be able to (call that plot armor). There's a fair share of adult
            topics and even gore, definitely not for the faint of heart.</h4>

            <h3>Super Crooks<br></h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 13 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>After discovering his electric superpower, Jhonny Bolt has plans to become the next greatest superhero. However, after an incident at his debut,
            he turns to a life of crime.</h5>
            <h4>An unfortunately short anime, Super Crook is the perfect mix of heist, superhero action, and sympathetic characters in an anime. The art style, plot, and even music choice reminds
            me of a comic,which isnt usually done in an anime. This show had me on the edge of my seat and holding my breath. Definitely one of the most uniquely drawn show.</h4>
            <h2>9/10</h2><br>

            <h3>Records of Ragnarok</h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 13 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>Every 1000 years, the Gods' Council assembles to decide the fate of humanity. After 7 million years of human history, the gods come to the decision that humans are irredeemable and
            must go extinct. However, the valkyrie Brunhilde proposes to give humanity one last chance to prove their worth and the gods agree to hold the battle of Ragnarok, a tournament with 13
            notable humans from across history against 13 of the most powerful gods engaging in duels to the death. Humanity will be spared if their side achieves 7 victories in the competition.
            To even the odds, each human is granted the assistance of a valkyrie who transforms into a powerful weapon tailored for their user's combat style called "Volund", at the risk of losing
            her life if the user is killed.</h5>
            <h4>Words cannot accurately describe how much I love this show. Every character has such a deep backstory, and you start rooting for the humans. I definitely cried more than I should. It's so sad
            when one dies whether it be human, god, or valkyrie. Theres probably a deep lesson or moral of the, but honestly, the show has you too invested to focus on that.</h4>
            <h2>10/10</h2><br>

            <h3>Kamisama Kiss</h3>
            <h4>2 seasons, 25 episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>Nanami is a homeless high schooler until she accepts an offer to live at a shrine - making her the new local god. With her handsome fox spirit familiar, Nanami learns the ins and outs of godhood
            and meets more spirits - including two who vie for her love!</h5>
            <h4>This has to be the sweetest, heart tendering romance anime I've ever watched. It's been two years, and Tomoe still holds a special place in my heart.
            Amazing. Phenomenal. I've never wanted to be someone so bad. Goals. Literally the definition of meeting the standard. Did I mention how sweet it is? It's also so
            fricking sad at some parts. THE DEVOTION. Ugh.</h4>
            <h2>:( /10</h2><br>

            <h3>Balance: Unlimited</h3>
            <h4>1 season, 11 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>The story centers around millionaire Kambe Daisuke, the heir to one of the wealthiest families in Japan, who is assigned as a detective to the Modern Crime Prevention Task Force (aka MCPTF),
            at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. Taking full advantage of his vast family wealth, he spares no expense in solving complex crimes, and has the tendency to evaluate everything including
            individual human lives in terms of their monetary value. Kato Haru, a detective with a compassionate heart who believes that money isn't everything, is chosen as Kambe's partner but is repulsed
            by his materialistic attitude. Having diametrically opposing personalities, witness how the two join forces to tackle seemingly unsolvable crimes and mysteries!</h5>
            <h4>The stereotype of down-to-earth protagnist meets rich, eccentric, and emotionally unavailable side character that doesnt know basic middle class things and learns
            from the main character but also ends up just taking the spotlight... yea. Funny, sweet, and an almost reliable type of comedy found in a lot of animes.</h4>
            <h2>7/10</h2><br>

            <h3>God of High School</h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 13 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>The main protagonist is Mori Jin, a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea. At the beginning of the story, he is invited to join a Martial Arts tournament called "The God of High
            School" (or GOH). The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three
            representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.<br> This intrigues Mori, and as he continues through the
            tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using "Borrowed Power", a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities
            (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: Full-Contact Karate expert Daewi Han and epeeist
            master Mira Yoo. These two would befriend Mori after their fights with him, and will become teamed together as the Korean Team after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds
            finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals.</h5>
            <h4>This Crunchyroll anime is from Webtoon series God Of Series, which was why I watched the anime. The anime is short, and I'd really reccomend the Webtoon version since things REALLY start to get
            interesting around the 50 chapter mark. I cant wait for the escalation. Back to the show. The art style perfectly encapsulated the comic as well, vibrant with lots of color and shapes during action scenes.
            I love Every. Single. Character. Jin Mori, love. Daewi, so sweet. Mira, my precious martial artist.</h4>
            <h2>8/10</h2><br>

            <h3>Dr. Stone</h3>
            <h4>2 Seasons, 34 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>After five years of harboring unspoken feelings, high-schooler Taiju Ooki is finally ready to confess his love to Yuzuriha Ogawa. Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding
            green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into stone. Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent,
            as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a
            few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable
            partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.<br>
            However, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification
            remains unknown.</h5>
            <h4>A science anime with hilarious characters, this show captivated my heart the first time I watched it years ago. There's an amazing plot twist later on in the show. I'm not quite sure how scientifically
            accurate the show is, but the plot is so unique. I truly haven't seen another anime quite like this.</h4>
            <h2>8/10</h2><br>

            <h3>Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun</h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 14 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>Chiyo Sakura is a cheerful high school girl who has fallen head over heels for the oblivious Umetarou Nozaki. Much to Chiyo's confusion, when she confesses to her beloved Nozaki, he hands her
            an unfamiliar autograph. As it turns out, the stoic teenage boy is actually a respected shoujo mangaka, publishing under the pen name Sakiko Yumeno! A series of misunderstandings leads to Chiyo
            becoming one of Nozaki's manga assistants.<br>Throughout the hilarious events that ensue, she befriends many of her quirky schoolmates, including her seemingly shameless fellow assistant, Mikoto
            Mikoshiba, and the "Prince of the School," Yuu Kashima. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun follows Chiyo as she strives to help Nozaki with his manga and hopes that he will eventually notice her feelings.</h5>
            <h4>I won't like, I did not like Sakura at the beginning. However, she and the show won me over. MGN is a slice of life anime, and heavily carried by Nozaki. The appeal relies heavily on how dumb and dense
            the characters are. That being said:</h4>
            <h2>7/10</h2><br>

            <h3>No Game No Life</h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 14 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>Sixteen sentient races inhabit Disboard, a world overseen by Tet, the One True God. The lowest of the sixteen—Imanity—consists of humans, a race with no affinity for magic. In a place where everything
            is decided through simple games, humankind seems to have no way out of their predicament—but the arrival of two outsiders poses a change.<br>On Earth, stepsiblings Sora and Shiro are two inseparable
            shut-ins who dominate various online games under the username "Blank." While notorious on the internet, the pair believe that life is merely another dull game. However, after responding to a message
            from an unknown user, they are suddenly transported to Disboard. The mysterious sender turns out to be Tet, who informs them about the world’s absolute rules. After Tet leaves, Sora and Shiro begin
            their search for more information and a place to stay, taking them to Elkia—Imanity's only remaining kingdom. There, the duo encounters Stephanie Dola, an emotional girl vying for the kingdom’s sovereignty.
            In desperation, she attempts to regain her father’s throne, but her foolhardiness makes her goal unachievable. Inspired by the girl's motivation and passion, Sora and Shiro decide to aid Stephanie in getting
            Elkia back on its feet, ultimately aiming to become the new rulers of the enigmatic realm.</h5>
            <h4>Definitely not for kids, this show is the perfect mix of snarky humor and insanely smart characters. It also has the appeal of gambling animes, with the protagonist outwitting every side character/villains
            when all the odds are against them. I believe NGNL was my first anime ever, and it's still my favorite.</h4>
            <h2>10/10</h2><br>

            <h3>God Eater</h3>
            <h4>1 Season, 13 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 2071. The world has been mostly destroyed by mysterious monsters known as the Aragami. An organization known as Fenrir was made to exterminate Aragami using
            'God Arcs', weapons made from Aragami cells. Those who specialize in exterminating Aragami are known as God Eaters. Their God Arcs originally could only keep a single form, however a new type has been
            discovered that can switch between gun and blade form. Since then, they have been classified new-types and the previous as old-types.</h5>
            <h4>There is a ton of gore and death, but the art is captivating. It also includes some of the most inspirational anime background music ever. The shows not over, but the betrayal and the unpredictable future
            of Lenka definitely has everyone on their toes. Still no update, however.</h4>
            <h2>7.6/10</h2><br>

            <h3>The Promised Neverland</h3>
            <h4>2 Seasons, 23 Episodes</h4><br>
            <h5>Surrounded by a forest and a gated entrance, the Grace Field House is inhabited by orphans happily living together as one big family, looked after by their "Mama," Isabella. Although they are required to
            take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they do not venture too far from the orphanage—a rule they are expected to follow no matter
            what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family, never to be heard from again.<br>However, the three oldest siblings have their
            suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama.</h5>
            <h4>I was told that this show would be extremely sad. That was not the case. This show is gory, cruel, and leaves you with a sense of hopelessness even though the shows not that intense. It just makes you 
            feel sick. All that aside, definitely reccomend. However, Season 2 of the anime is not based off of the manga.</h4>
